# cup
A free and open source remake of the bot from the discord server 'cup'.

## Features
- [x] You are only allowed to say **cup** in this server. (Send a message if a message other than cup is said in a designated channel)
- [x] If the word mug is said, give the user a 'banished' role.
- [ ] A user with a banished role has to say sorry five times in a specific channel to get the banished role removed
- [ ] Use the 'cups' command to get cups and legendary cups (on a cooldown) and see how many cups and legendary cups you have
